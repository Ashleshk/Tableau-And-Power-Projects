Through my analysis I obsereved that in recent year the number or people leaving the company had been on the rise. But the company has also been hiring lost of new people and overall Atlas Labs is a growing company. But let us look more into why people leave.

Two of the key factors to increased attrition where 'Travel Frequency' and 'Overtime'. This trend is constant across all departments. And the HR team should look more into this, and figure out how they might hire some new people to lessen the burden on e.g. those that work overtime.

In terms of demographics, Atlas Labs workforce is predominantly young, with the most significant attrition rates observed among the age groups 18-22, 23-27, and 28-32. Gender, however, does not appear to significantly affect attrition rates. Looking into how they can retain young talent and what this age group is intrested in might be an important step to take.

When looking at other factors such as compensation and benefits, I founf that employees with no stock options have a notably higher attrition rate. Interestingly, employees with level 3 stock options also show a higher attrition rate than those with level 1 or 2 options. Atlas Labs can look into giving more employees stock option as thees seems to help retain them.

From a geographical perspective, most of Atlas Labs employees are based in CA, which also has the highest attrition rate among the three states represented in the workforce (CA, IL, NY).

Interestingly, I found very weak to almost zero corraltion between staisfaction and people that left the company. The HR team might want to look into how these surveys are being conducted to better understand this aspect.

We can also see that it is important to get past the first year of employmeent, as there is a large drop in attrition rate from year 1 till 2. The Atlas Labs HR team should revisit tehir strategies for new hire, onboarding and support.
