# Minnesota Department of Transportation dashboard project
 

* **Description**- In this project, the goal is to find out if we need to make any infrastructure changes, like adding or changing lanes, entrances, or exits. We want to have a dashboard that monitors the incoming traffic data. If we can find trends in the data, we can figure out what changes we should make. The dashboard should track a couple of key things. The most important chart will monitor the traffic volume throughout the year. It'd be great if you could organize that by year, month, week, day, and hour. It'll help us figure out where the patterns are. Another chart we'd like to have is one that compares the traffic volume to weather conditions. We want to better understand the weather's effect on traffic behavior. And finally, we want to know which holidays have the highest traffic volume. That might help us plan some infrastructure updates so we don't have any lanes blocked off when they're needed the most.


* **Requirement**-  
They have been specific about the three charts theyâ€™re most interested in including for this dashboard:
1. Traffic volume throughout the year; ideally organized by year, month, week, day, and hour
2. Traffic volume in different weather conditions
3. Traffic volume on different holidays
