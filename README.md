* **Description**- In this project, I explored a real-world job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company called DataSearch.
    - I have used Power Query to investigate and clean the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. 
    - used DAX to build insightful visualizations of your findings. 
    - Finally, I bring it all together using everything Power BI has to offer to create a business dashboard so that you can answer questions for the DataSearch team.

* **Insights** - I learnt to analyse about company, jobs they provide and skills set they look for.
    - In Company Analysis, I was able to recognize the variation in the average pay, based job postings and company size and sector it belongs to.
    -  How is Average year experience and posting count has changed in terms of company size and company level for different jobs
    - built a heatmap of Skill required by employer based on job.

* **Outcomes**
    - It helped me to understand me and my friends to understand which skills are essential for Data Scientist, Data Analyst role.
