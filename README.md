* **Description**- In this project, I explored a real-world job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company called DataSearch.
    - I have used Power Query to investigate and clean the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. 
    - used DAX to build insightful visualizations of your findings. 
    - Finally, I bring it all together using everything Power BI has to offer to create a business dashboard so that you can answer questions for the DataSearch team.
